# How to Pseudocode

Based on the provided test code, your own driver test code, or challenge instructions, you should have an idea of what your code needs to accomplish.

In the pseudocode section of your `my_solution` file, identify the input to the class or method and output (what you expect to get).

You probably already have driver test code written. Looking at your tests, write specific step-by-step ideas in code-like English to pass each of the tests. 

Each line should be something you can easily translate into code. 
For help with writing pseudocode, take a look at this [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html) example.

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*
