# Peer-Pairing Sessions


## Purpose
Pair programming has gained in popularity among companies as enabling developers to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes, but it's not as easy as it may seem. Pair programming can enable both partners to learn and grow if communication is open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect. Building relationships like this takes practice, so we've incorporated pair programming into Phase 0!

## Expectations
As part of Phase 0, students are expected to pair program with a member of your cohort at least three times in unit 1 and four times in units 2 and 3.** 

* It is up to you to arrange pairing sessions with your cohort mates at a time that suits both parties**
* You should set aside at least 45 minutes for each pairing session
* You should work on any of the challenges for the week except for the solo challenges.
* When you arrange your pairing sessions, you should decide the following:
  1. What challenge to work on
  2. Whether you will 1) attempt the challenge first or 2) decide to save the challenge for your pairing session and not work on it before the session
  3. What time you need to finish the session


**Note: You should select pairs from your unit accountability group. You can access each other's email addresses on the cohort page on Socrates. Click on the person's picture and it will let you access their profile. 



## Courtesy

Please keep in mind that all students are busy and working hard to balance work and Phase 0 requirements. If it turns out you can not make the session you've scheduled with your pair for any reason, please contact your pair as soon as possible. Try your best to work from a quiet place with a reliable internet connection. 


## Success Guidelines

You will be successful if you:

	- Check in with your pair according to the Pairing is Caring* video. 
	- Decide which of you will be driver and navigator, discuss what each role requires, and stick with it. 
	- Ask your pair to switch roles so you each know your responsibilities
	- Keep communication open and tell your pair when you need time to think
	- Ask your pair for their opinions and ideas often
	- Allow yourself to make mistakes
	- Submit feedback to help your pair improve
	- Use feedback you've received to become a better pair
	- Alternate between driving and navigating. Aim to spend about 50% of your time in each role.
