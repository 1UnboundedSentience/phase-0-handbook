# Peer-Pairing Sessions
***

## Purpose
Pair programming has gained in popularity among companies as enabling developers to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes, but it's not as easy as it may seem. Pair programming can enable both partners to learn and grow if communication is open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect. Building this language takes a lot of practice, so we've incorporated pair programming into Phase 0.

## Expectations
As part of Phase 0, students are expected to pair program with a member of your cohort at least six times each unit.** 

* It is up to you to arrange pairing sessions with your cohort mates at a time that suits both parties**
* You should set aside at least 45 minutes for each pairing session
* You should work on any of the challenges for the week except for the solo challenges.
* When you arrange your pairing sessions, you should decide the following:
  1. What challenge to work on
  2. Whether you will 1) attempt the challenge first or 2) decide to save the challenge for your pairing session and not work on it before the session
  3. What time you need to finish the pairing session


**Note: You can access other student's email addresses on the cohort page on Socrates. Click on the person's picture and it will let you access their profile. 
###### For SF Students:
You need to pair with the people assigned to you in your pairing assignments. See the link in your google+ community resources. Pairing assignments are divided into two sessions per week, but these are suggestions, not requirements. You can schedule sessions with any pair at any time during the three weeks, just make sure you communicate with your pair and decide which challenge to work on.

## Courtesy

Please keep in mind that all students are busy and working hard to balance work and Phase 0 requirements. If it turns out you can not make the session you've scheduled with your pair for any reason, please contact your pair as soon as possible. Try your best to work from a quiet place with a reliable internet connection.

## Success Guidelines

You will be successful if you:

	- Check in with your pair according to the [Pairing is Caring](http://vimeo.com/76662569) video. 
	- Decide which of you will be driver and navigator, discuss what each role requires, and stick with it. 
	- Ask your pair to switch roles so you each know your responsibilities
	- Keep communication open and tell your pair when you need time to think
	- Ask your pair for their opinions and ideas often
	- Allow yourself to make mistakes

## Feedback
###Submit Feedback

You must complete feedback on [Feedbackinator](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) for every pairing session you complete to receive credit for it. If you do not submit feedback for your pair, we will not know you have done the pairing session, and you may be flagged for not meeting Phase 0 expectations. 

Make sure you watch [Engineering Empathy: EQ and Feedback](http://vimeo.com/76762772) prior to giving feedback.**

**All feedback must be anonymous to protect privacy.** Please, abstain from writing your pair's name anywhere in the free-form text. Other students review each piece of feedback and rate it for kindness, actionability, and specificity. Feedback will not reach a student if it is not rated high enough on each of these measures by other students. Feedback will reach your pair when you select them in the drop-down. 

Writing good feedback is challenging and time consuming. In past students have noted that the feedback they received in unit one helped them, but feedback gradually became less specific and actionable. Be generous with your time and make sure to write feedback that will help your pair grow as a partner and as a programmer. 



### Meta Feedback

In order to make sure you and your pairs receive the feedback you've each submitted, **all students are required to rate at least 20 pieces of feedback per unit.** Unfortunately, there is no counter in Socrates for you to keep track of the amount you rate, so it is up to you to find a way to keep track of how many pieces you've rated. Instructors have access to these figures, so you will be contacted if you are not keeping up with this expectation. 

TIP: Rate 5 pieces of feedback at a time until you submit at least 20 pieces.

### Problems and Tips
Most students report that peer-pairing sessions are the most helpful and beneficial aspect of the Phase 0 program, but sometimes students report having bad sessions. Here are some tips for the common complaints we've heard.

Problem: "My pair isn't responding to my messages."<br>
*Tip: How did you contact them? A number of students have had issues contacting others via google. Try contacting your pair via email. If you still have difficulty, let your facilitator know and they can try to put you in contact with one another.*

Problem: "I got stood up by my pair, and I'm angry because my time was wasted."<br> 
*Tip: Email your pair and present your side from your persepective. If you say something like, "I felt upset and disrespected by..." Let them know that there actions had consequences. Note: Please do not use feedbackinator to address this kind of issue.*


Problem: "The other person took over and performed both roles."<br>
*Tips: If you didn't clarify who would drive and navigate from the outset, you can ask to clarify it anytime in the session. If you did identify who would drive and navigate, but you feel you aren't able to play your role, you can ask your pair to take a step back on your duties so you can fulfill them. Try asking questions about potential design choices and offer your own ideas. Finally, if nothing is working, you can tell your pair that you need a break from the session and say you can reschedule for later since you don't feel the session is beneficial at the moment.*
