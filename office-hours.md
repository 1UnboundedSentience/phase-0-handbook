# Office Hours

Office hours are a time that you can ask questions and bring issues you are having to a phase 0 guide. Some examples of office hours issues are: looking over code, working through parts of a challenge, problems setting up git, getting your development environment on track.

To access the video chat, you need to add the office hours and tutoring calendar to your google calendars.

Follow this [link](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=devbootcamp.com_nlp0d3j0ot6q9rgll6bu6vpjqg@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) and press the tiny rectangle on the bottom right with the + Google Calendar. Confirm on your calendar and you will be able to join a video call.

You do not need to sign up for office hours, just jump into the hangout and ask your questions anytime during that hour. You don't need to stay the whole time.

Please note: Office hours are times to get help with concepts in the Phase 0 curriculum. We know that many of you take some extra time to work on other projects you want help on, but advanced questions from these projects should wait for DBC on site.

*If the guide who created the session is not there, please email phase 0 <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com>.
