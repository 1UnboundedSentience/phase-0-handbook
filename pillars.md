# IKE: Integrity, Kindness, and Effort

At Dev Bootcamp, we have three expectations that guide our actions (this includes staff). We expect every person to uphold these values every day in Phase 0 and in the program. By enrolling in DBC, you agree to these pillars. 


## Integrity
In simplest form, this means being honest. When I was in elementary school, it was taught to me as "doing the right thing even when no one is watching." 

At Dev Bootcamp, we expect people to be in integrity by:
- Showing up on time
- Working through the curriculum each week
- Communicating with your accountability group and Phase 0 staff if you are struggling
- Pairing with others
- Asking for help
- Submitting feedback
- Posting and responding to questions on the forum
- Going through the entire process outlined in each challenge

## Kindness
We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice," however. Being kind is not always the same as being nice. Being kind means being friendly, generous, and considerate. It does not preclude giving constructive feedback as long as it is Actionable, Kind, and Specific (ASK). 

We expect all students and staff to show kindness by providing feedback and code reviews to one another, informing one another when we have fallen out of integrity, and by bringing ourmselves into each challenge every day. We also show kindness by respecting others. 


## Effort
This may the most straight-forward pillar. In essence, we expect every person to do their best every day. This means that we expect you to put yourself into every challenge and do your best to meet each learning competency. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (including staff) for help. 

We expect everyone to do their best to complete the work we've assigned, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing the challenge if nothing is learned. The DBC experience is about *learning*. We expect students to show they have mastered each learning competency by completing the challenges. 

***

Not meeting these expectations are grounds for being asked to leave the program (at any stage). 

We will send periodic updates to students who have not submitted their work, missed Guided Pairing Session (GPS), or have fallen out of integrity in other ways. These emails are not meant to shame students. Rather, we want to remind students of their promise to come to DBC in integrity, with kindness, and with effort everyday. We want to give all students the opportunity to meet these expectations. We recognize difficulties arise which cause students to be unable to meet these each week, so it's vital students communicate with staff and their fellow students.
