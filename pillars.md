# The Three Agreements: Integrity, Kindness, and Effort (IKE)

At Dev Bootcamp, we have three agreements that guide our actions (this includes staff). We expect every person to uphold these values every day in Phase 0 and in the program. By enrolling in DBC, you agree to these agreements. 


## The first agreement: Integrity
In simplest form, this means being honest. When I was in elementary school, it was taught to me as "doing the right thing even when no one is watching." 

At Dev Bootcamp, we expect people to be in integrity by:
- Showing up on time
- Working through the curriculum each week
- Communicating with your accountability group and Phase 0 staff when you are struggling
- Pairing with others
- Asking for help
- Submitting and rating feedback
- Posting and responding to questions on the community
- Going through the entire process outlined in each challenge

Part of being in integrity also means that when you fall out of it for whatever reason (such as being a human being) you own up to it.  Most of the time all it takes is and aknowledgment of being out of integrity and everybody can move on.

## The second agreement: Kindness
We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice;" they are simply not the same thing. Being kind means being friendly, generous, and considerate. It does not preclude giving constructive feedback as long as it is **A**ctionable, **S**pecific, and **K**ind (ASK). 

We expect all students and staff to show kindness by providing feedback and code reviews to one another, informing one another when someone has fallen out of integrity, and by bringing ourselves 100% into each challenge every day. We also show kindness through showing respect to others and our space. 


## The third agreement: Effort
This may be the most straight-forward agreement. In essence, we expect every person to put in the maximum amount of energy into each challenge every day. This means that we expect you to do your best to meet each learning competency. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (including staff) for help.

We expect everyone to complete the assigned challenges, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing the challenge if nothing is learned. The DBC experience is fundamentally about *learning*. We expect students to demonstrate effort and their mastery of each learning competency by completing the challenges. 

***

Not meeting these agreements are grounds for being asked to leave the program (at any phase). 

We will send periodic updates to students who have not submitted their work, missed a Guided Pairing Session (GPS), or have fallen out of integrity in other ways. These emails are not meant to shame students. Rather, we want to remind students of their agreement to come to DBC in integrity, with kindness, and with effort everyday. We want to give all students the opportunity to meet these agreements. We recognize difficulties arise which cause students to be unable to meet these each week, so it's vital students communicate with staff and their fellow students.
