# Frequently Asked Questions
This will be updated as you ask questions on the google+ community. 

**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via google hangout. If you signed up properly, you should have an event on your google calendar with a link to join the video call. Join the call at the appropriate times. Follow [these instructions](intro-gps-signup.md) to sign up. 

**Q: How do I change my DBC email address?** <br>
**A:** Unfortunately this isn't very simple at this point since we use multiple systems. You should first change your email address on [Dev Bootcamp's Application Website](http://apply.devbootcamp.com/) and then contact us at phase0@devbootcamp.com with the following template to change your address: 

  Please include (just copy paste and fill in):
  
  1. Name:
  2. Cohort and location:
  3. Old email address:
  4. New email address:
  5. Do you want your email changed in Socrates as well? 

**Q: Can we visit or use DBC space in Phase 0?** <br>
**A:** In order to maintain an optimal learning environment for students in phases 1 - 3, phase 0 students are not permitted to study in DBC sites prior to starting phase 1. Phase 0 students may, however, sign up for a tour ([CHI](http://my.setmore.com/shortBookingPage/0df7e742-ac22-4daf-bb03-7d5519a01fe1), [NYC](http://my.setmore.com/shortBookingPage/64ca252f-bf57-4680-b027-c2ed82bcb493), [SF](http://my.setmore.com/shortBookingPage/df34b42d-2a7d-47d9-8a24-f8bfe36de9f0)) from 4-6pm on Tuesdays or attend DBCx meetups ( [CHI](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-DevBootcamp-Speaker-Series/), [NYC](http://www.meetup.com/DBCx-NYC/), [SF](http://www.meetup.com/DBCx-SF-Dev-Bootcamp-San-Francisco-Open-Learning/)) in the space during events. Please do not drop by at any other time. If you have a question about the tour email hello@devbootcamp.com. 

**Q: What are the hours at DBC?** <br>
**A:** This depends on the location. Ask the [facilitator](contact-and-support-list.md) in the introductory session.

**Q: I'm trying to add the office hour calendar to my calendar, and it says I don't have access. What do I do?**<br>
**A:** There are a few reasons this could happen, but it's almost always a permissions issue. As you can imagine, we don't want just ANYONE able to add themselves to
sessions, so we only allow certain people viewing and editing access. We do this through google groups. 

What email address are you receiving our communications from? If it is different from your google calendar account, you'll need to submit an email address change request (shown above). 

If you have two separate google accounts, make sure you are signing up under the one we sent the invite to. If you want to change it, please submit and email address change request. 

**Q: I didn't receive a google calendar invite. How can I get access to the necessary calendars?**<br>
**A:** Because we use google groups to maintain permissions (far easier than inviting everyone separately), you won't always receive an email. But if your address is correct in the google group, you automatically have access. Go to the google+ community and find the two calendar links under "About this community." You can then add them. 

**Q: Is DBC closed on US federal holidays?**<br>
**A:** DBC only honors the following holidays that occur during phases: Thanksgiving and Independence Day (July 4). During those days, the staff has the day off, but the curriculum is still up and needs to be completed. 

**Q: Is Phase 0 going to be operating over the December 2-week break?**<br>
**A:** No. Phase 0 will be suspended over the same two weeks that the rest of the campuses are closed. The dates of closure are December 22 - January 5. You can still do work during this time if you wish, but staff will not be responding to emails or updating curriculum during this time. 

Make sure you read through the handbook thoroughly. Substitute "Phase 0 Handbook" for "Syllabus" in the following cartoon.
