**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via google hangout. If you signed up properly, you should have an event on your google calendar with a link to join the video call. Join the call at the appropriate times. Follow [these instructions](intro-gps-signup.md) to sign up. 

**Q: How do I change my DBC email address?** <br>
**A:** You'll need to do two things to start the process for changing your email. Log into [Dev Bootcamp's Application Website](http://apply.devbootcamp.com/) and change your account email first. Then complete the "Email Address Change Request" form located on your task list. 

This form will only be viewable once you officially start Phase 0. Please try to change your email at least one week prior to your phase 0 start. Once you get a Socrates login, you will need to complete the email address change request form.

**Q: What are the hours at DBC?** <br>
**A:** Building and Core hours vary by location. 

Core hours are the hours of instruction where students are required to be on site and teachers will be present.

In **Chicago**, core hours are 8:00am - 5:00pm, and lunch is from 11:30am - 1:00pm.

In **New York City** and **San Francisco**, core hours are from 9:00am - 6:00pm, and lunch is from 12:30pm - 2:00pm. 

Building hours for New York City and San Francisco are 7:00am - 2:00am. Students are not allowed to be in the building outside of these hours. 

In Chicago, the building is open 24/7, but students are not allowed to stay the night. 

**Q: Is DBC closed on US federal holidays?**<br>
**A:** DBC only honors the following holidays that occur during phases: Thanksgiving and Independence Day (July 4). During those days, the staff has the day off, but the curriculum is still up and needs to be completed. 

**Q: Is Phase 0 going to be operating over the December 2-week break?**<br>
**A:** No. Phase 0 will be suspended over the same two weeks that the rest of the campuses are closed. The dates of closure are December 22 - January 5. You can still do work during this time if you wish, but staff will not be responding to emails or updating curriculum during this time.
