**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via google hangout. Depending on your location, you will receive an email or another form of communication with a link to the room. You should receive an email at least the day of your session. Please contact your facilitator if you do not receive an invite.
