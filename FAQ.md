# Frequently Asked Questions
This will be updated as you ask questions on the google+ community. 

**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via google hangout. Depending on your location, you will receive an email or another form of communication with a link to the room. You should receive an email at least the day of your session. Please contact your <a href="/contact_and_support_list.md" target="_blank">facilitator</a> if you do not receive an invite. 

**Q: How do I change my DBC email address?**</br>
**A:** Unfortunately this isn't very simple at this point since we use multiple systems. You should first change your email address on <a href="http://apply.devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp's Application Website</a> and then contact your <a href="/contact_and_support_list.md" target="_blank">facilitator</a> to inform him/her that you want to change your email address. Be sure to tell him/her your old and new address.
