# Frequently Asked Questions
This will be updated as you ask questions on the google+ community. 

**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via google hangout. Depending on your location, you will receive an email or another form of communication with a link to the room. You should receive an email at least the day of your session. Please contact your [facilitator](contact_and_support_list.md) if you do not receive an invite. 

**Q: How do I change my DBC email address?** <br>
**A:** Unfortunately this isn't very simple at this point since we use multiple systems. You should first change your email address on [Dev Bootcamp's Application Website](http://apply.devbootcamp.com/) and then contact your [facilitator](contact_and_support_list.md) to inform him/her that you want to change your email address. Be sure to tell him/her your old and new address. 

**Q: Can we use DBC space in Phase 0?** <br>
**A:** This is up to the location. In San Francisco, students are not able to use space on site during Phase 0, but they are invited to visit the space on Fridays between 3:00 and 5:00pm. Other locations may have other policies. 

**Q: What are the hours at DBC?** <br>
**A:** This depends on the location. Ask your [facilitator](contact_and_support_list.md) in the introductory session.
