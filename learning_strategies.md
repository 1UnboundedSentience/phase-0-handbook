# Learning and Achieving in Phase 0

## Approach to Learning
Dev Bootcamp will likely be a different learning experience and style than you've experienced before. And that's a good thing. Learning how to program is not as simple as memorizing a set of information. Learning how to program requires learning how to *learn*. Web technology changes every minute as people create and invent new programs, frameworks, and languages. To excel in this field you need to:
 
1. Love learning
2. Be willing to make mistakes
3. See mistakes as opportunities rather than failure
4. Ask questions
5. Create and apply an approach for solving complex problems
