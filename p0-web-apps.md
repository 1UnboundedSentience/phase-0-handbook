# Web Applications

We ask you to use many different web applications during Phase 0. These are in the process of being consolidated into a portal to improve the student user experience, but we aren't there yet. It can be pretty overwhelming to get used to all of these different applications, on top of learning to code, so we wanted to provide an overview of each system so you can familiarize yourself with each and make the transition into Phase 0 easier.

# 1. GitHub
Dev Bootcamp uses GitHub to host its curriculum. Due to the nature of the program, the curriculum repositories are private, which means that students will be unable to get access to the curriculum until their GitHub name is added to a team or organization.

All members of a team or organization will have access to each other's work, but all repositories must remain private based on the student agreement.

In order to get added to our organization we need each student to link their GitHub account in Socrates and the Phase 0 App. Once you have updated both profiles with your GitHub user name, we will add it to our organization. Once we do this, GitHub will send you an email with the invitation to join our team. Use the link in that email to join the team and get access to the curriculum.

If you get a 404 error when you try to access the curriculum, that means we do not have your user name in our system. First, update both of your profiles then email phase0@devbootcamp.com to ask to be added. Please make sure to include your user name in the email.


# 2. Phase 0 App
[https://phase0.devbootcamp.com](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com)

You will sign up for Intro Sessions, Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS), and view and enter [office hours](office-hours.md) through the app.  Once you receive your email invite to the app, follow the link to activate your account.

You must use the SAME GitHub user name in this activation as the one you authenticated with on Socrates. If these are mis-matched or you revoked access, you will be unable to log in. If this is the case, please email phase0@devbootcamp.com to help you troubleshoot this issue.

## Intro Sessions
The app should make signing up for sessions fairly simple. Simply click "Sign Up for an Intro Session" to view available times and sign up for a session. You should receive an email confirmation once this is done.

## Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS)
To sign up for a GPS, select the GPS you want to sign up for, click the "Sign Up" button to see available times, then click "Sign Up" again next to the session. You will then receive an email confirmation. When you need to enter the session simply return to the app to join the session.

## Office Hours
To attend office hours, sign into the app and click on the link to join the hangout. The link for the Google Hangout will be posted two hours before the session is scheduled to take place.

# 3. Application Site
[http://apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com)

Phase 0 uses the Dev Bootcamp application site to track progress throughout Admissions and Phase 0.

Each week, you will be asked to submit links to your work into a submission form. You will also communicate with us how many hours you spent on the curriculum, conduct a self-assessment of the learning competencies, and provide optional feedback on how the week went and your experience with the program overall. When submitting this form please make sure you use "Save and Exit" to finalize the submission.

You will also request tutoring sessions and file for an extension on this site as well.

This system is used internally to track your progress over your time at DBC, from the time you first apply to the time you graduate the program. Even though you used this system in your Admissions process, you are in Phase 0 now and using this app to track your progress in Phase 0.

# 4. Google+ Communities
Google+ Communities are the hub for cohort communication, mass communication from Phase 0 staff, and a place for you to ask questions. You will also find links to the curriculum and other important sites under the "About this Community" section.

Pairing requests are also handled in this community using the "Pairing Requests" discussion board.

You can receive turn on email notifications to send you an email each time someone posts on this community (unfortunately you cannot enable them only for certain threads, that's an issue with Google+). We encourage you to have notifications turned on to not miss important announcements. DBC Staff will very rarely be sending mass emails. Emails with The Phase 0 Team will only be used for personal conversations about your progress in the program or any concerns you have.

You should check the community every day. Staff makes announcements largely in the "Curriculum Releases and Updates." It is each person's accountability to keep up to date with what is posted there. During Phase 0 you will not receive mass emails unless there is an exceptional circumstances.

# 5. Socrates (Feedbackinator)
[https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback)

Socrates is only used in Phase 0 for Feedbackinator. Once you get into the Feedbackinator simply find your pair's name and leave them feedback about the session. Please remember to be **annonymous** with this feedback and that good feedback is Actionable, Specific, and Kind.

This is also where you will go to rate others feedback to ensure it is indeed Actionable, Specific, and Kind. Once you have received more than four pieces of feedback, you will be able to see feedback other have left for you.

Socrates used to be a student hub for curriculum, but is currently only used for Feedback and viewing your local cohort. Please disregard anything not related to feedback and the viewing of your local cohort.

# 6. Twitter
We use Twitter for sharing blog posts with others in the DBC, and specifically Phase 0, community through the use of unique hash tags. We decided to use Twitter for this because the Google+ Community was getting over-run and students in other cohorts and DBC staff could not access student's blogs easily.

We understand that some students have never used Twitter and are reluctant to do so. It is, nevertheless, required that Phase 0 students use Twitter during Phase 0. For students who have developed a personal brand and followers on Twitter, you may decide to create an account just for your developer side where you will post this work.

You should also feel free to use the link to the massive twitter feed (linked in the Google+ Community) to see what others have written.

If you would like others to look at your code and give them feedback, we suggest doing this on Twitter because it makes it a bit easier for others to find the links. Because your repositories are private, only other Phase 0 students and staff will be able to see your work.

#7. Class Marker (Not pictured)
This is where weekly quizzes are hosted and will be taken. You will need to log in with the email address you have associated with Dev Bootcamp.
