# Welcome to Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0!

During Phase 0 you are going to start to become familiar with the learning culture we have here. In short, it is a fine balance between taking responsibility for your own education and being supported by DBC. Taking reponsbility for your learning means tracking your own progress, exposing your ignorance to your instructors/guides, and reaching out when you have questions and need help. The DBC community will provide the support and guidance you need to accomplish your goal of starting your career as a web developer. One part of the support you will get is being held accountable by the DBC Team and your fellow cohort mates to complete the different parts of the curriculm. At times it will get confusing or frustrating but thatâ€™s all part of the process.

Another imporant thing to note about this learning style is it's not necessarily about the right answer or the most perfect code. It is about your **own, honest, best** attempt at tackling the challenge. Sometimes, your attempts will not even produce a working solution, and that is OK. If your solution ends up being 30 lines of pseudocode and you don't know where to begin, make a comment saying where you are stuck and submit it. Then you can reach out for more help (from other members of your cohort or a guide) in order to complete the challenge. The most imporant thing is your own self assessment of if you are learning and understanding the concepts presented in the challenges. To aid in this self assessment we will give you feedback on your six Guided Pairing Sessions and four solo challenges. This feedback is intended to be just that, feedback. It is not to say if you are going to get kicked out of the program or not. It is to give you an idea of your progress, and more importantly your progress over time so you know where you have to put in more effort or if you need to ask for more help.

**During Phase 0 there will be things you are expected to complete every week. Here is a high level look at these expectations then you can go to that section of the Handbook to get more information**

* Six [Guided Pairing Sessions](guided-pairing-sessions.md) divided between the three units

* Two [Peer-Pairing Sessions](peer-pairing-sessions.md) per week (this is not true for the first week)

* Giving and rating [feedback](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/feedback.md) for your cohort mates every week.

* Submitting all the challenges and reflections as specified in the Curriculum at the end of the week

* Four [solo challenges](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/solo-challenges.md) that will be used for code reviews

* You will be expected to put in at least 15-25 hours of work per week (depending on previous experience) 

You are now starting Unit 1. Phase 0 is divided into three Units. Each Unit is three weeks long. You will need to complete all work for a unit prior to moving on to the next unit. This is true regardless of whether an extension is used.
