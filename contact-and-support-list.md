## Email Etiquette and Notes: 
- If you send an email, please wait to 24 hours to receive a response, and if you don't hear back, please reply to the thread you initiated (instead of openning a brand new thread). The more emails and different threads we get, the more time we need to process.
- Global Staff work from 9am-6pm PST Monday through Friday. We do not work on weekends which means we are not checking our email or the Google+ communities. We will get to any emails as soon as possible when we are back in the office on Monday.
- Please only email the addresses above. To ensure the best customer service, we require all emails to be trackable in our system. Emailing a person directly will require them to forward your email to the address, thereby slowing the response time.
