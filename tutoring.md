# Tutoring

## Sessions
The phase 0 guides provide a few 30 minute one-on-one sessions for you to use. These are limited, but can be helpful if you are feeling particularly stuck after consulting your peers and attending office hours. Due to the short timeframe of these meetings, prepare your questions ahead of time to get the most out the sessions.

There are also [office hours](office_hours.md) if you some small issues that needs looking at.


## Expectations
If you are struggling with the amount of material or specific concepts and want to work with a guide one-on-one, please sign up for a tutoring session. 

Come to the tutoring session with specific questions or a challenge (but not solo challenges!). You'll want to be prepared because 30 minutes goes by very quickly!


## Peer Pairing vs. Tutoring

Tutoring sessions are not meant to substitute for pairing with your peers. The primary way to learn in Phase 0 is through peer-pairing. 

Please don't avoid pairing with your peers because you are embarrassed about your progress. Many people feel overwhelmed by the amount of work in Phase 0. That is *slightly* intentional. DBC is a stressful experience, and learning how to program is also stressful because it's probably completely new to you. You are not alone! Reach out to others to get help. That's the beauty of DBC, people want to help and they will learn a ton by going through challenges with others. Put yourself out there. If you are behind, say so. I guarantee you will find others who are behind as well. 

## Signing Up
