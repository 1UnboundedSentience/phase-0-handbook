# Tutoring

## Sessions
We aim to have at least 10 thirty-minute tutoring sessions each week available to all phase 0 students (That's 10 spots for around 225 students). These are meant to provide one-on-one assistance to students who are struggling and to clarify  fundamental concepts and get assistance when needed. 

Please also use [office hours](office_hours.md) for assistance. 


## Expectations
If you are struggling with the amount of material or specific concepts and want to work with a guide one-on-one, please sign up for a tutoring session. 

Please come to the tutoring session with specific questions or a challenge (but not solo challenges!). You'll want to be prepared because 30 minutes goes by very quickly!


## Peer Pairing vs. Tutoring

Tutoring sessions are not meant to substitute for pairing with your peers. The primary way to learn in Phase 0 is through peer-pairing. 

Please don't avoid pairing with your peers because you are embarrassed about your progress. Many people feel overwhelmed by the amount of work in Phase 0. That is *slightly* intentional. DBC is a stressful experience, and learning how to program is also stressful because it's probably completely new to you. You are not alone! Reach out to others to get help. That's the beauty of DBC, people want to help and they will learn a ton by going through challenges with others. Put yourself out there. If you are behind, say so. I guarantee you will find others who are behind as well. 

## Signing Up
Students must sign up for each session **at least 6 hours in advance**. Sign up by viewing the office hours calendar and:

1. Clicking on a session you want. (Sessions should have [FULL] in the title if they are full).
2. Check that no one beside the tutor is in the session under "guests". 
3. If no one is in the session, add your email address under "guests" and add [FULL] to the beginning of the title. **Make sure you save the changes!**
4. When you add your email to the session, you will also have the same session appear on your personal 
gmail calendar. So if everything was done properly, you should see two sessions side by side.
5. **DOUBLE CHECK** your email is added to the master session and that your personal copy looks the exact same (has a video call and guests). If there are any discrepancies between the master and your own, something probably messed up somewhere. Try again.  

#### Canceling
To cancel, you will need to go to the **master calendar** and click the 'x' next to your email address - then SAVE. **DO NOT USE the RSVP to cancel** - That is the event on your *personal* calendar and will not remove you from the session on the master. You need to cancel attendance **at least 6 hours in advance** to give other students a chance to sign up. If you cancel, be sure to delete [FULL] from the title.
